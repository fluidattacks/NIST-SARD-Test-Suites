 * @description
 * CWE: 319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
 * BadSource: NetClient Read password from a web server with WebClient
 * GoodSource: Set password to a hardcoded value (one that was not sent over the network)
 * Sinks: SqlConnection
 *    GoodSink: Decrypt the password from the source before using it in database connection
 *    BadSink : Use password directly from source in database connection
 * Flow Variant: 68 Data flow: data passed as a member variable in the "a" class, which is used by a method in another class in the same package
