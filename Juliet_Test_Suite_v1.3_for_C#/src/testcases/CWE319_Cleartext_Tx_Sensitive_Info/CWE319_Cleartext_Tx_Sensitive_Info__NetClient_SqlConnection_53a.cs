 * @description
 * CWE: 319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
 * BadSource: NetClient Read password from a web server with WebClient
 * GoodSource: Set password to a hardcoded value (one that was not sent over the network)
 * Sinks: SqlConnection
 *    GoodSink: Decrypt the password from the source before using it in database connection
 *    BadSink : Use password directly from source in database connection
 * Flow Variant: 53 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one method through two others to a fourth; all four functions are in different classes in the same package
