 * CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
 * BadSource: ReadLine Read data from the console using ReadLine
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: array_write_no_check
 *    GoodSink: Write to array after verifying index
 *    BadSink : Write to array without any verification of index
 * Flow Variant: 72 Data flow: data passed in a Hashtable from one method to another in different source files in the same package
